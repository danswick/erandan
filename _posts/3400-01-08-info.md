<h4>Coming to Chicago</h4>

We spent the bulk of our twenties living in and learning to love the great city of Chicago. Many of our family and friends live right down the road, but if you're joining us from out of town, we'd love to make a few suggestions for what to do and see while you're here. 

<h5>Lodging</h5>

<span class="small-icon icon-lodging"></span>We've lined up a small block of rooms at Spring Hill Suites on the Northwest side. Reserve a room by <strong>August 17th</strong> to get your spot.
