        <p>We'll be hanging out on Friday night before the wedding to spend some time with friends and family before the big day. We aren't having a traditional rehearsal dinner, but still wanted to see friends and family, especially those visiting us from out of town, before the big day. If you are able, stop by and join us for drinks and appetizers. If you can't make it two days in a row, that's okay! We'll be sure to give you a hug on Saturday.</p>
